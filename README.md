# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It allows two players to take turns and compete to win by forming a row, column, or diagonal of their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 game board.

## How to Play

1. Start the game.

2. Enter the names of Player One and Player Two when prompted.

3. Player One will then choose between 'X' and 'O' to represent their symbol.

4. The game board will be displayed with numbered positions, and Player One will start first.

5. Players take turns to input the position (1-9) where they want to place their symbol.

6. The game will check for a win condition after each move, and if a player wins, the game will end.

7. The winning player's name will be displayed, or if it's a draw, the game will end.

8. The game will keep running until you decide to exit.
